# Learning statistics with R

Contains LaTeX source for

DJ Navarro (2017). Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners. (Version 0.5.1). http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html

Scripts to generate the images are included, as are the data sets from which they are drawn. In principle, this repository and the lsr package itself should include everything needed to reproduce the book from scratch.
